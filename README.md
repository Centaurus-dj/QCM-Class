# Quizzio
  A project made for school.

### How to see the code ?

  Because of using an engine, a lot of files and folders have been added but the ones written by Centaurus are listed below:

  Every paths starts from the base directory, the one where this file is placed.

  - /game/functions.rpy: Here are written all the functions used for the project, not all the functions are used
                         in the final version but were used for stabilizing the version.

  - /game/images.rpy: This file can be ignored, it's just storing some code lines about images used during the game.

  - /game/labels.rpy: This file can be interesting, it's all the system from the start to the end, with the call of
                      the screens and the loop for the questions.

  - /game/myscreens.rpy: This file store the different screens used during the game, it has been made to not be overflowed
                         by all the default screens created by default by Ren'Py.

  - /game/questionaries.rpy: This file contains all the questions and the answers stored by categories in a dictionary.
                             The set used is: ["question", [True, "Correct Answer"], [False, "False Answer"]]

  - /game/splashscreen.rpy: This file contains the cinematic displayed when we start a game.

  - /game/variables.rpy: This files contains the global variables, some defined under python system some defined under
                         Ren'Py system.

  - /game/*.rpyc: They are compiled files, you can open it but it won't advance you in any way.
